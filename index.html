        <h2>About Molly</h2>
        <img src="assets/images/molly.jpg" alt="Molly" class="img-thumbnail">
        <p> My name is Molly McDevitt and I am a twenty year old beginning a fulfilling career in web
          development. I graduated from Portsmouth High School in 2016 and decided to forego the typical college
          route to instead travel and take more time to discover my true passions.</p>
        <p>After a year of splitting my time between travel and work, I decided to try my hand at different job
          opportunities, which eventually
          led me to a conversation with a family friend who has over twenty five years of experience as a woman
          in technology. The exchange sparked an interest and as I dove deeper into my research of the industry,
          I realized the incredible creative and professional opportunities available to full stack developers -
          and here we are! </p>

        <p> Outside of web development I enjoy reading, playing and writing music, poetry, yoga and being in
          nature. I believe that we are defined by our passions and our willingness to pursue them, and I am
          extremely excited to begin cultivating mine for web development!
